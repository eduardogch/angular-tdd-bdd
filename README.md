# Angular-Test

A simple example to work with TDD and BDD in AngularJS 1.5

TDD - Test-driven Development is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

BDD - Behavior-driven Development is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight.
